# GigaBoard v1 Chaos Log

total number of hours spent: 8 hours

yo. this is the official journal of mistakes, accidental wins, and ctrl-z moments for building my first custom keyboard  
called it **GigaBoard v1** because it sounds powerful.


**June 19**  
spent like 1 hour scrolling through mechanical keyboard reddit wondering why people build boards with like 48 keys  
decided i’m gonna make my own  
opened KiCad, stared at the empty screen like it owed me money  
made a rectangle and called it progress.  
keyboard engineering? completed it mate.



**June 20**  
2 hours figuring out what a diode matrix even is  
youtube taught me more than school ever did  
placed the switches. looked slightly cursed but i vibed with it.  
deleted half the traces accidentally. recovered like a hero using ctrl+z  
10/10 experience. would stress again.



**June 21**  
measurements day. 1.5 hours of fighting with mm vs inches vs my brain  
finally mapped out where the USB-C’s gonna go.  
also started thinking about 3D printing the case  
feeling like i’m building the next NASA spacecraft at this point



**June 22**  
PCB layout fixes. 2 hours.  
aka: me dragging traces around like spaghetti  
added labels like “R1, C1” everywhere. looks professional. absolutely not professional.  
keyboard looks like it works on screen. reality? unknown.  
confidence = high. skills = questionable.



**June 23**  
spent 1 hour searching for keycaps that won’t make me broke  
ended up window shopping artisan keycaps i’ll never buy  
also thinking of adding per-key RGB. am i ready? no. am i gonna try anyway? absolutely.


**TOTAL HOURS SPENT SO FAR:**  
around 7.5 to 8 hours of chaos, mistakes, learning, and vibes  
no switches soldered yet. no keycaps in sight. but this is the grind  
GigaBoard v1 is coming. stay tuned. it’s gonna slap 🔥
