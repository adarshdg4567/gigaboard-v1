# Gigaboard v1

Welcome to **Gigaboard v1** a fully chaotic, DIY, tenkeyless mechanical keyboard that I built basically for vibes.  
Two PCBs, a bunch of parts, and me learning PCB design on the fly.

Is it practical? Nah.  
Is it fun? Absolutely.

## Whatâ€™s inside?

- **Tenkeyless Layout**, Standard layout, compatible with Cherry MX-style switches (I used Kailh Box Crystal Jades clicky bois)
- **Per-Key RGB**, Reverse mounted SK6812 (Neopixel) LEDs for maximum gamer energy
- **16x2 Character Display**, Retro LCD, mainly for flex (TBD on actual use)
- **Knob (Rotary Encoder)**, Twist it to feel something
- **Powered by Raspberry Pi Pico**, Because itâ€™s small, cheap, and CircuitPython just works
- **Two Custom PCBs**, Designed in KiCad, manufactured properly, because perfboards are cringe
- **Aesthetic Screws & Standoffs**, To hold the chaos together

| Qty  | Part                                   | Cost (USD)     | Why itâ€™s here                          |
| ---- | -------------------------------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Raspberry Pi Pico                      | $5             | Brains of the build                    |
| 87   | Kailh Box Crystal Jade Switches        | ~$55           | The thock, the click                   |
| 87   | SK6812 Reverse-Mount LEDs              | ~$20           | RGB everywhere                         |
| 1    | 16x2 Character LCD (HD44780)           | $4             | Retro display vibes                    |
| 1    | Rotary Encoder + Knob                  | $2             | For spinning, obviously                |
| 1    | USB Type-C Breakout/Adapter            | $2             | So it actually connects                 |
| 1    | USB Type-C Angled Adapter (90Â°)        | $3             | Makes cable management slightly better |
| ~100 | Diodes (1N4148 or similar)             | $6             | Keyboard matrix wizardry                |
| 2    | Custom PCBs (both plates)              | ~$25           | This is the real deal                   |
| ~12  | M2 Screws + Standoffs                  | ~$3            | Holding the thing together              |
| ~    | Connectors, headers, JSTs, vibes       | ~$5            | Wiring party                            |
